## Introduction 
[Back to Table of contents](README.md#table-of-contents)

[RadiAction](http://radiaction.site) is a monitoring and alerting platform for health risk factors associated with time integrated quantities. It is a big data pipeline which uses personal sensor measurements for location monitoring and produces alerts based on graph relations.

As a concrete example I'm simulating a facility where employees are working with radioactive sources. Two streams of user data are collected: dose rate (from personal dosimeters) and user location (room) information. The pipeline reconstructs the room specific dose rates from the merged streams, and calculates the time integral of both user and room doses in a sliding window. 

If a user's dose exceeds the predefined limit the closest (in distance) of his direct colleagues is notified. If a room's dose is too high - hence it's considered contaminated - all users in <= 2 distance are notified.

## AWS Clusters
[Back to Table of contents](README.md#table-of-contents)

[RadiAction](http://radiaction.site) runs on four clusters on AWS:
<ul>
<li>4 m3.large nodes for Kafka and Spark Streaming</li>
<li>3 m3.large nodes for Cassandra </li>
<li>1 m3.large Neo4j</li>
<li>1 m3.large nodes for Flask and the Kafka Producer Pythons script</li>
</ul>
As of July, 2016, this system costs ~$? a day with AWS on-demand instances used.

## Data Pipeline
[Back to Table of contents](README.md#table-of-contents)

The image below depicts the underlying data pipeline.

### Data source
The data streams are synthesized based on a predefined room graph (each node with a degree of 3). In each time point the users are moving to an adjacent room with a set probability (2/60) and then the dose rate is assigned based on the locations signal. Normal rooms have a background rate value 1, while contaminated rooms have an elevated background of 5. Since radiation exposure due to normal work is expected an additional rate of 9 is added to the users' signal with a probability of 1/60. 
The dose rate and room information are sent to separate Kafka topics. A sample of the input data is shown below. 
![Alt text](app/static/img/input.png?raw=true "Input data")
Each event of the room stream contains the user id (uid), timestamp (t), new location (nl), and old location (ol) fields. While events of the sensor stream comprises of user id (uid), timestamp (t), and dose rate (dr).

### Spark Streaming
Spark Streaming joins the two streams based on the user id and timestamp. The this new stream is mapped to calculate the integrate over a sliding window. Since Spark Streaming defines the window operations based on incoming event time (instead of the timestamp contained in the data) each window is filterd to make sure that for each timestamp the last n events are summed.

### Data bases
The resulting dose rates and dose values are stored in Cassandra: partitioned by user id and clustered by timestamp. Time is reversed for the doses to make last value look ups efficient.

The room and user graphs are stored in Neo4j. When a room's dose is higher than the preset threshold all its first and second degree connections are looked up so all users currently located in these rooms can be notified.
If a user exceeds his dose limit the shortest path between his and his 5 direct colleagues' location is calculated. The closest connection is alerted. Neo4j performs graph calculations effectively: a shortest distance calculation in a graph with 100k nodes (node degree 5) takes ~0.3 s.

## Performance
[Back to Table of contents](README.md#table-of-contents)

The current system uses a sliding window of 100s windowLength and 5s slideInterval. With a 600 events/s input rate the processing time for each micro batch varies between 5-8 s.
